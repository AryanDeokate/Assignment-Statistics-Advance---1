    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The standard normal distribution is the normal (Gaussian) distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. It is important because many problems are standardized to it (z-scores), and many statistical methods (like CI, hypothesis tests) use properties of the normal distribution."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The CLT states that the sampling distribution of the sample mean approaches a normal distribution as sample size increases, regardless of the original population distribution (provided variance is finite). It justifies using normal-based inference (CIs, hypothesis tests) for sample means when sample size is sufficiently large."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A confidence interval gives a range of plausible values for an unknown population parameter (e.g., mean) computed from sample data, together with a confidence level (e.g., 95%) which describes the long-run frequency of such intervals capturing the true parameter."

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The expected value (mean) of a random variable is the long-run average value it would take over repeated trials; for discrete variables it's the sum of values times their probabilities, and for continuous it's the integral of x times the pdf."
